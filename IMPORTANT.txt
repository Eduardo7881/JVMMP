JVMMP version 1 release

!WARNING! Don't use a Java 7 or below versions. the code will only work in Java 8 (accurate) and up (don't tested yet)

This program was made by EduardoPlayss121!
If you see the source code and find "com.davvefan.nbsjava" it's me, because i am fan of the Minecraft Note Block Studio made by Davve! :)

!WARNING! Only reading midi files are supported from now, the midi maker (add notes, remove notes) are manual and boring and it doesn't work for now.

!WARNING! Don't Re-upload or make changes on my program without leaving the credits! else You can be banned from GitHub or someting... O_o

That program inspired to make my Java Virtual Machine Midi Player (JVMMP)
This is currenly in beta and some bugs can be found.

Support me giving a star on this repository!

- USED LIBRARIES (you don't needed to install these libraries!) -
JavaZoom (JLayer) (For MP3 Player)
