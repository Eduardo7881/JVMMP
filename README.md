# JVMMP - Java Virtual Machine Midi Player

## Version: 0.29 beta

**!WARNING!** Don't use Java 7 or below versions. The code will only work in Java 8 (accurate) and up (not tested yet).

This program was developed by EduardoPlayss121.

If you see the source code and find "com.davvefan.nbsjava", it's me, because I'm a fan of Minecraft Note Block Studio made by Davve! :)

This program was inspired by Minecraft Note Block Studio and aims to create a Java Virtual Machine Midi Player (JVMMP).
